I have made a number of applications, both for Android, Windows and the web. Generally, I like to use native APIs where possible rather than using frameworks such as Apache Cordova that allow cross platform development in a single language. This means that, for example, any Android apps I&#8217;ve made are in Java, and any Windows apps are in C#.
