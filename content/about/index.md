Hello, and welcome!

I'm Ryan Murthick, and this is my personal website.

I'm a software engineer currently working remotely at Clock, the company I did 
a year's placement at, and will be starting my final year of university soon.

Although I've historically done a lot of C# / Java development, I've increasingly
ended up doing web development.

Here's some other places you can find me:

  * [My Github](http://github.com/rymate1234): All of my open source projects, plus some unfinished ideas
  * [My twitter]( http://twitter.com/rymate1234): I occasionally tweet.
