I occasionally make games in a free program called <a title="Click here!" href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Construct 2</a>. It allows you to make browser based HTML5 games without learning the horror that is JavaScript.

I also make games in other languages on occasions too!

This page features a list of my games. Will be updated (in)frequently.
