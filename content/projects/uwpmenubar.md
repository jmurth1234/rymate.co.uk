This was a library made to replicate the common menu bar component usually found in desktop apps in a UWP app. This had replicated a number of the common patterns, including hover to switch menus and full keyboard control. However MS has since made their own and this is thus no longer necessary.

### Tech Used

 - **Development**: .NET UWP Nuget package
