At work, we needed a library to calculate the vehicle tax for a vehicle, and as far as I could gather at the time one did not exist. So I created a library that could be used to calculate road tax for most cars and vans.

### Tech Used

 - **Development**: JavaScript, no reliance on Node or the browser, developed with ES Modules and transpiled with `microbundle`
 - **Testing**: Uses ESLint for linting and Jest to run test suites
 - **CI**: Uses Microsoft Azure Pipelines to run tests for PRs and master commits
