Back when I played Minecraft, I created a simple winforms app to render maps with the Overviewer without having to resort to the command line. It's had sporadic activity over the years, with it recently being active to support the new Python 3 Overviewer and to release on the Windows Store. There are plans to convert this into a Desktop Bridge UWP app.
