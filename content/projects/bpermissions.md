This plugin was the largest project I actively maintained when I was focused on
it, both in scale and number of users, with the plugin having over 500k 
downloads before I took over in 2013. This was also my first experience 
inheriting an older codebase I'd never really touched before.

### Tech Used

 - **Development**: Java / Bukkit API
 - **CI**: Various jenkins servers
