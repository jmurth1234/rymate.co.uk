This plugin is a Superperms Manager for Bukkit! bPermissions focuses on being unique from the rest of the Permission managers. It's very simple to set up and use, it's lightning fast, and  fully featured.

**Some features:**

* bPermissions has a gui client specifically designed to make running a server so easy that you'll forget that you ever used any other permissions plugin. Get it here!
* bPermissions has a unique command structure, never before seen in a permission manager. It's best used for adding lots of nodes to a user or group from the console or in-game, less typing
* bPermissions has everything you would expect from a Permissions manager. Prefix and suffix support, inheritance, per-player permissions, multiworld support, promotion/demotion tracks, and even group priorities for multi-group setups.
* Note - bPermissions only defines prefixes and suffixes. You need a chat plugin such as bChatManager for them to show up in chat.
