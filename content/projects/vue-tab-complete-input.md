`vue-tab-complete-input` is an OSS vue component I made for the Signal IRC web
client, as I needed a way of having a way of doing irc style tab completion
within a web client, and with none being available I decided to make one and
open source it.

### Tech Used

 - **Development**: Vue JS component, with a Vuepress site for docs
 - **CI**: Netlify to build and host the docs site, manual builds for npm 
 module
