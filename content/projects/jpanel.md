Back when I owned a Minecraft server, I wanted to give admins a way of monitoring the server console without giving them SSH access, and I wanted to try out the [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) Java web framework, so I decided to make a web panel.

### Tech Used

 - **Development (backend)**: Java, SparkJava web framework, distributed as bukkit plugin
 - **Development (frontend)**: SCSS for styles, mostly jQuery for JS
