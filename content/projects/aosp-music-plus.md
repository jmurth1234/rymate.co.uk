Originally, I published pretty much intended as a throwaway -- I'd managed to compile this app for an extremely low end device I had at the time, so I decided to also put it on the store in case a similarly lightweight was something people wanted. It turns out that it definitely was wanted, with a current peak install base of over 500k devices and peaking at over 25k downloads a day. 

The app currently lies abandoned, mostly because the API level is too low to produce any more updates, however it did serve as a good learning experience for enhancing an older application with features for newer devices.

### Tech Used
