In 2017, I [published](http://rymate.co.uk/2017/08/issues-releasing-winirc-1-5/) an article with some some future plans for WinIRC, including refactoring the app. This is the first major result of that refactor - the IRC cnnection portion decoupled entirely from the UI, and distributed as a Nuget package. This will be the base of a future WinIRC 2.0 and SignalIRC, an as yet unreleased ASP.NET IRC client I'm working on

### Tech Used

 - **Development**: .NET Core 2 (distibuted as a .NET Standard library)
 - **CI**: Gitlab CI to start with, has since moved to Azure Pipelines
