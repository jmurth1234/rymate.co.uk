Whilst on placement, I had terrible internet in the flat I was renting, and wanted a way to listen to YouTube videos using a lower amount of bandwidth. I also wanted to try out Next.JS and utilise React Hooks in an application, so I ended up making a small React SPA for it.

**Tech Used**

* Development: Next JS framework for the whole stack.
* Deployment: Uses both Heroku and Zeit Now free tiers, with the site handled via Zeit Now and the video processing handled via Heroku.
