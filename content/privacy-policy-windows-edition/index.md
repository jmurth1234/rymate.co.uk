I care very deeply about privacy, and so can confirm that your personal data is never transmitted to me from any apps in the Windows Store - any logins are safe.

Some apps may store your settings in your Microsoft Account, meaning you don't need to setup the apps on a new device. There's no method within the apps to turn this off, however you can turn this off system wide.

I also have anonymous analytics on my apps - these transmit basic usage stats and errors to Microsoft so I can improve the apps. No personal details or logins are transmitted as part of these analytics, and I don't sell anything I receive.

If you don't want to send analytics to me, you can turn it off in the latest version of WinIRC.
