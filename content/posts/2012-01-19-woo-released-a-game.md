# Tank Shooter

<div>
  <p>
    This is my first game that i&#8217;ve released that was made with greenfoot.<br /> The object of the game is to defend the forest from the bombs that the plane drops. You can do this by either shooting the plane, or shooting the bombs. Remember to avoid them though ðŸ˜‰

    <strong>Controls:</strong><br /> Arrows to move, space to fire.

    <strong>With thanks to:</strong><br /> Google Images &#8211; The background, plane and game over screen were all found there. (I&#8217;m rubbish with graphics, what can I say? :P)
