So today I decided to make a lightweight theme for this website. It&#8217;s based upon the <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">underscores.me</a> starter theme in order to make things easier for me. Although it&#8217;s pretty barebones at the moment, I&#8217;ll be making it look a bit snazzier over time. For instance, I want to put the site sidebar in a hamburger menu when on mobile devices and other smaller screens. I was going to give it a style similar to Google&#8217;s Material Design, then I realised something like that would be absolutely pointless for a blog, so I decided that instead it would just be a reasonably lightweight theme.

Also the blog post on setting up a print server on a Pi is definitely <del>coming soon</del> probably never happening.
