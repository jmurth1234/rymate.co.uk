So I&#8217;m working on a WordPress theme. I&#8217;m basing it off the default one, and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll be an improved version of the default. You can see an early version of it on this site! I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll include the following features!

  * Two or Three different layouts: a traditional blog layout, a windows 8 style layout, and a combination of both of those.
  * Colour schemes!
  * Animations!
  * More!

If people have suggestions, feel free to contact me.
