So I&#8217;ve been using my iPad for a few months now, and although it is a great machine, it has some bad points. Here is my rundown of the iPad mini.

**Good points:**

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;" data-mce-style="line-height: 13px;">The screen is simply the best screen I&#8217;ve used on a mobile device. It&#8217;s the clearest screen, and it is very good with watching youtube or the BBC iPlayer on it. It might not be a Retina display, but to be honest I&#8217;ve never really noticed the pixels when using it. It&#8217;s also a really good size &#8211; After using the iPad mini, the standard iPads just seem too big now!</span>
  2. The UI is&nbsp;silky&nbsp;smooth. When using apps, I very rarely experience any form of UI lag. Scrolling is smooth, and there appears to be none of the jerkiness that I get with my android phone. The only UI lag I&#8217;ve seen is in Bad Piggies when I make some massive huge vehicle in the sandbox, and oddly enough Skitch and Evernote is really quite laggy on occasions.
  3. iPad apps are really well made. I haven&#8217;t found a single bad app yet, all of the apps seem to be well designed and easy to use. This might be a huge advantage of the iOS walled garden that seems to be a major complaint about iOS. Sure, you can&#8217;t install apps from 3rd party sources very easily, and apps on the app store might have to go through a rigorous process to get onto it, but it does mean that the vast&nbsp;majority&nbsp;of the 800,000 apps on the App Store have a very good user experience.

**Bad Points**

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">The typing experience is terrible. I sincerely hate the typing experience on the iPad mini. It isn&#8217;t terrible, but there&#8217;s quite a few annoyances that I really hate. I quite often type quickly on the screen, and as I have big hands it means I quite often make typo&#8217;s, one of the most annoying ones being when I hit the &#8220;m&#8221; or &#8220;n&#8221; key when I want to hit the spacebar. When it does happen, more often than not I do it again so autocorrect doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;auto correct&nbsp;it. Selecting text on the iPad is a pain too. When I hold down on the screen to select text, a magnifying glass shows up to help you select the text. More often than not though, the iPad &#8220;cleverly&#8221; attempts to highlight the entire paragraph when I only wanted a single line.</span>
  2. iOS is severely limited. I can&#8217;t change any of the &#8220;default applications&#8221; that Apple forces upon us. I might not want to use safari as my browser, instead I want to use firefox. But Apple thinks all iOS users need is safari, and that alternate browsers are evil. You can&#8217;t even download firefox on iOS, and all other alternate browser are either a webkit wrapper or a &#8220;cloud based&#8221; browser.  
    I can&#8217;t change parts of the UI either. On android, if my phone came with a crappy keyboard, I&#8217;d just install&nbsp;another&nbsp;one off the google play store. I&#8217;m stuck with the iOS keyboard. I want to be able to change aspects of my device. I like the idea of Apple&#8217;s walled garden, but it&#8217;s like a garden which you can get some excellent flowers for, but you can&#8217;t change the tree in the middle even though it looks ugly!

**How apple could fix the bad points**

All apple needs to do to fix the bad points is make the iPad more like a computer. By that, I mean allowing users to change the system keyboard, or change the web browser, or choose what App they want to open stuff in. If Apple doesn&#8217;t want users doing that, make it a setting that allows users to turn on &#8220;Advanced Customisation&#8221; so the average joe can&#8217;t just install new keyboards and then not know how to use them.

Other than the bad points mentioned, I think the iPad is a really good device, and I would certainly recommend it to people who already have an Apple product.
