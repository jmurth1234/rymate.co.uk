It&#8217;s been over a year since my last post &#8211; mainly due to the stress of AS levels, and then settling in to a new college. I have at least kept the website up though!

I&#8217;m going to start posting more stuff on here &#8211; now I&#8217;m doing a ICT and Business course at college, there&#8217;s some small projects I&#8217;m making  in the ICT part of my course as part of my coursework that I may put up here.  There are, of course, be other projects unrelated to my coursework &#8211; I may post about them here! One such project with my Raspberry Pi is that I made a print server with it that allows printing across the network with a samba server for windows devices and cups printing for all other devices, which I will post about in the next week or so. I&#8217;m also working on numerous improvements to Rymate Notes which may or may not surface.
