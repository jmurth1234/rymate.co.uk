WordPress has served me well for a good few years now, but I decided last year that it's time for an overhaul of my site to use more modern web development practices and for me to have much more control over it. I also wanted much more emphasis on the projects I've done, rather than have them buried as a small link on a subsection of the site.

This led me to create this site -- a Hugo powered static site with a couple extra server side scripts to manage Netlify style continuous integration and GitHub auth for the Netlify CMS used for content management. It also utilises the [InstantClick](http://instantclick.io/) JS library for Gatsby like SPA navigation and page preloading in a couple KBs of JavaScript

The site is fully open source, and available to download at  <https://github.com/rymate1234/rymate.co.uk>.
