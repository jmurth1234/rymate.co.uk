This is a small post with my thought of the iPad mini having used it for about 4 hours. I&#8217;ll write a fully fledged review when I get the time.

**The hardware**
  
The iPad has very good build quality. The screen is large for its size. Charger port is quite good as it can be inserted either way.

**Initial Setup**
  
Thankfully, you don&#8217;t need a computer to set the device up, as mine is broken. Just turn it on, wait about a minute and you&#8217;re greeted with a 5 to 10 minute setup wizard.
  
This wizard was easy to use and follow, and it setup all the basics, such as my iTunes account and wii details. It also managed to restore all the apps, plus settings, from my old iPod touch, via he iCloud service. This, I thought, was useful.

**The interface**
  
This thing is very easy to use. Launching an app is a simple as tapping the icon on the home screen. Going back to the home screen is as easy as pressing the circular button on the front of it. You can see open apps by double pressing the home button.
  
The interface is also very smooth. Launching apps is reasonably quick, and there is no lag when scrolling web pages, unlike on my budget android. 

**Using it**
  
The apps available for the iPad are very good quality. Unlike Android, the apps seem to have very good quality. They are also very easy to use.
  
Typing on the iPad is also decent. The keyboard is big enough for me to type comfortably on for long periods of time, such as for writing this blog post. It is also reasonably accurate.

**Conclusion**
  
Seems like a reasonable device. It is quick, and easy to use. If you have the money, buy it. Or get a nexus.
