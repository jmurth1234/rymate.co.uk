Ok, so since Rymate Notes now has AdMob adverts, I&#8217;m required to give a privacy policy.

The AdMob privacy policy is available atÂ http://www.admob.com/home/privacy, but the gist of it is that the adverts can use anonymous data from your phone (except location as I don&#8217;t give access to that) for adverts. I **do not** give them access to **any notes** store in the app.

If you buy the &#8220;Rymate Notes Donate&#8221; app, none of the information we receive from Google when you buy it is used. Honestly I just ignore it.

If you need more infomation, post in the comments and I&#8217;ll be able to answer any queries.
